<h2>
    The Synopsis
</h2>

<p class="espacetexte">
    About a hundred years ago, the Titans almost completely wiped out humanity. The Titans, who are usually several metres tall, do not seem to have any trace of intelligence and eat humans for pleasure, not for food. 
</p>


<p class="espacetexte">
    The few humans who have resisted the massacre are a little over a million strong and have done so by retreating into a territory surrounded by several walls that are so high that not even the largest of Titans can see over them. The fortress city is made up of three walls, the one in the middle is the Sina Wall, the second is the Pink Wall and finally the biggest of the three walls is the Maria Wall.
</p>

<p class="espacetexte">
    As the story unfolds, the young Eren and his sister Mikasa, will witness the death of their mother devoured by a titan, Eren has only one dream: to enter the elite corps in charge of discovering the origin of the titans, and annihilate them to the last one...

<h2>
    Why is marked me ?
</h2>
<p>
    This book marked me a lot because the universe of the work is very dark, stressful at times. This feeling is surrounded by a plot with lots of twists and turns, with endearing characters, we discover several points of view and thanks to that we have several contradictory opinions. That's why this work made such an impression on me.
