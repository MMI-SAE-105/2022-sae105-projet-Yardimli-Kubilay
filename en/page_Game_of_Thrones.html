<h2>
    The Synopsis
</h2>
<br>

<p>
    The story takes place on the continents of Westeros and Essos, where various great families are fighting to conquer the Iron Throne and rule the kingdoms of the Seven Crowns.  
    <br>The story begins when King Robert Baratheon, the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, travels north to meet his old friend Eddard Stark and take the place of the king's hand as the former has just died. Lord of the North of Winterfell and of House Stark, Eddard never leaves his lands. However, he reluctantly agrees to leave for the capital, Portreal, with his two daughters, Sansa and Arya.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    We will also follow the story of Jon Snow, Eddard Stark's bastard son, who is about to join the famous Night's Watch in the northwest of Westeros.
    <br>For over 8,000 years, this guard has lived on the other side of the Wall, a gigantic edifice of ice, stone and magic, which forms the border between the northern lands and the Seven Crowns and defends the kingdom of Westeros against the threat of the White Walkers, but this one is closer to a story than to reality.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    King Robert Baratheon rebelled against the so-called Mad King Aerith II Targaryen, leading to his children being exiled to the continent of Essos. We will follow the story of the children of the Mad King, across the strait to the southeast, on the continent of Essos, Viserys Targaryen, the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms in exile, prepares to take back the kingdom with his sister Daenerys and they will try to regain the Iron Throne with the help of three dragons.

<h2>
    Why is marked me ?
</h2>
<p>
    This series is one of my first medieval fantasy series, and I really enjoyed it. It opened me up to a world I didn't know, and since then I've been interested in medieval and fantasy series or both, depending on the genre. What I like are the political shenanigans surrounded by intrigue with lots of twists and turns, with endearing characters, we discover several points of view and thanks to that we have several contradictory opinions. That's why this series made such an impression on me.
